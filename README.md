### Abstract
The City of St. Louis makes their [Citizens Service Bureau data](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/service-requests.cfm) publicly available. These data ship in separate irregularly organized `.csv` files, the most recent of which is renamed with each subsequent release. This lack of stability makes their integration with our [`stlcsb` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/stlcsb) challenging. As a workaround, we offer a single unified `.rda` formatted data file specifically to support our package. If you use `R`, we encourage you use access these data via the [`stlcsb` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/stlcsb). If you use another tool for data analysis, we encourage you to access these data directly from the [City of St. Louis](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/service-requests.cfm).

### Access via `stlcsb`
To download these data using the [`stlcsb` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/stlcsb), use the `csb_get_data()`:

```r
csb_incidents <- stlcsb::csb_get_data()
```
